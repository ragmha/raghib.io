# raghib.io

A minimal independent technology blog built with Astro, TypeScript, plain CSS,
and Bun.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (required)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or newer
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

> On Windows, using [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is recommended for a smoother experience.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raghib.io.git
cd raghib.io
bun install
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).

## Commands

```bash
bun dev                      # local development
bun run check                # Astro and TypeScript checks
bun run build                # static production build
bun run check:seo             # audit the fresh production build (requires Chromium)
bun run check:vitals          # controlled mobile LCP/CLS regression checks
bun run generate:social-card  # regenerate public/social-card.png
bun run sync:projects         # refresh projects from the selected GitHub star list
bun test --bail               # unit and publication-contract tests
```

## Projects

The Projects page is generated from the public repositories in
[`ragmha/blog-projects`](https://github.com/stars/ragmha/lists/blog-projects).
Run `bun run sync:projects` with an authenticated `gh` CLI to refresh
`src/content/github-projects.json`, then commit and redeploy. Per-project
overrides (category, description, demo/extra links) live in
`src/content/project-snapshot.ts` and survive future syncs.

## Writing and project writeups

Posts live in `src/content/writing/`. A project can optionally have a longer
writeup at `/project/<project-name>/writings/`, authored as MDX in
`src/content/project-writeups/`; set `published: true` when it's ready to go
live. Writeups are separate from the Writing archive/RSS feed.

Rendered diagrams live in `public/diagrams/`; editable `.excalidraw` sources live
in `src/assets/diagrams/`. Edit a source in Excalidraw, then export the matching
SVG. Keep SVG diagrams as native `<img>` elements with explicit `width`, `height`,
and descriptive `alt` attributes; shared writing styles scale them to their
container. Put raster content images in `src/assets/` and render them with
Astro's `<Image />` or `<Picture />` components so responsive `srcset` values and
optimized formats are generated automatically. Icon credits and reuse terms are
in `public/diagrams/ICONS-LICENSE.txt`.

## SEO readiness before merging

The `SEO readiness` workflow runs on every pull request into `main` and on
merge-queue builds. Its job name is the required-check identifier: keep it
stable when editing the workflow. A required status-check rule on `main`
enforces the gate; merely adding a workflow does not prevent merging.
The deployment workflow repeats the same checks before uploading the site.

Run the gate locally with:

```bash
bunx playwright install chromium # once, if the browser is not installed
bun test --bail
bun run build
bun run check:seo
bun run check:vitals
```

The audit reads the generated HTML in Chromium with page scripts disabled.
It requires unique titles/descriptions, one H1, canonical and social metadata,
a real social-preview image, valid author/article schema, working internal links
and image assets, and correct sitemap/robots/RSS discovery. Every published
source entry must have a corresponding rendered article with matching metadata;
drafts must not leak into the build. An intentionally empty writing archive is
valid. Editable `.excalidraw` originals belong outside `public/`.

Published writing needs a title, description, date, and nonempty body.
Whitespace and HTML comments alone do not count as a body. The body check
looks for content outside comments; it does not sanitize or render HTML.
Use `published: false` for writing drafts; project writeups default to unpublished.
An optional `seoTitle` gives search results a shorter title without changing the
visible article heading. Shared metadata lives in `SeoHead.astro` and
`src/lib/seo.ts`; regenerate the social card after changing its text or design.
No article text or draft is automatically published by the audit.

The vitals check measures mobile LCP and CLS under fixed network and CPU
throttling. The gate checks technical readiness, not rankings, keyword demand,
factual accuracy, or field Core Web Vitals. Those still need editorial review and
production evidence. After deployment, submit `/sitemap-index.xml` in Search
Console using an account authorized for the site.
